    "For Python programmers Ibis offers a way to write SQL in Python that allows for unit-testing, composability, and abstraction over specific query engines (e.g.BigQuery)! You can carry out joins, filters and other operations on your data in a familiar, Pandas-like syntax. Overall, using Ibis simplifies your workflows, makes you more productive, and keeps your code readable."
